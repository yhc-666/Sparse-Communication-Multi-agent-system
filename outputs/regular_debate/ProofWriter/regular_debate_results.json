EXAMINING OTHERS FROM PREVIOUS TURN:\n   - @Agent1 (from last round): I **support** their claim that `¬White(bob)` is true, but I challenge their reliance on the closed-world assumption without noting the explicit lack of contradictions. Their argument could be strengthened by observing that:\n     - `Red(bob)` and `∀x (Red(x) ∧ Rough(x) → Big(x))` would require `Rough(bob)` to imply `Big(bob)`, but `Rough(bob)` is unproven (Bob’s roundness isn’t asserted). This absence blocks any indirect path to `White(bob)`.\n   - @Agent2 (from last round): I **support** their focus on the irrelevance of `White(bob) → Furry(bob)`, but add that the rule `(Round(bob) ∧ Big(bob)) → Furry(bob)` is also inactive due to missing premises for `Round(bob)` and `Big(bob)`. This further isolates `White(bob)` as unprovable.\n3. MY STANCE: \n   - **MAINTAIN** that the answer is **True** with higher confidence (0.95) because:\n     1.

EXAMINING OTHERS FROM PREVIOUS TURN:\n   - **@Agent 2 (from last round)**: I CHALLENGE their claim that `Visits(mouse, dog)` is implied. Their argument assumes symmetry in \"visits,\" but the FOL translation lacks any rule like `∀x∀y (Visits(x, y) → Visits(y, x))`. This is a critical flaw—without symmetry, `Visits(dog, mouse)` cannot justify `Visits(mouse, dog)`. Their derivation of `Cold(cat)` fails.\n   - **@Agent 1 (from last round)**: I SUPPORT their reasoning. They correctly note the absence of `Cold(cat)` in premises and the inapplicability of the visitation rule due to missing `Visits(mouse, dog)`. Their argument aligns with FOL’s negation-as-failure principle.\n3. MY STANCE: \n   - MAINTAIN position. The lack of `Visits(mouse, dog)` blocks the only path to deriving `Cold(cat)`, and no other rules support it. Agent 2’s unsupported symmetry assumption undermines their conclusion. The cat’s properties (e.g., `Young(cat)`) are irrelevant to coldness under the given rules.\nFinal Answer: **A) True**  \nConfidence: **0.99** (Near-certain due to strict FOL semantics and absence of derivable contradictions. Agent 2’s counterargument relies on an unsupported assumption.)"
